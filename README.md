Authors: Verhaegh, Ruben F.A., Kiezebrink, Jacco J.E., Nusteling, Frank, Rio, Arnaud W.A., Bendicsek, Marton B., Duivesteijn, Wouter \& Schouten, Rianne M.

Experimental code
-----------------

The synthetic data experiments can be run with mainsynthetic.py. The synthetic datasets are created with synthetic_data_generation.R and stored in folder Synthetic/. The results are stored in Synthetic/allresults.xlsx and analyzed with evaluate_synthetic.R. 

The real-world data experiments can be run with mainrw.py. The dataset and results can be found in RealWorld/. The figures are created with evaluate_rankings.R.
